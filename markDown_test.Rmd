## Parametric distribution evaluation
The kaplan-meier (KM) non-parametric curve for our survival data was fitted with nine relevant right-skewed parametric distributions in order to determine which curve best described New Zealand's terrestrial vertebrate eradication history.

```{r Distributions, include= FALSE}
source("code/R/analysis/00-initialization.R")
source("code/R/analysis/01-survDist.R")
```

```{r Distribution eval, echo= FALSE}
#fit KM curve to parametric distributions
fit_survDistr(surv_data, 
              surv_parameters$base_distr, #distributions available in R
              surv_parameters$custom_distr)
```

The best fitting distributions (based on maximum log likelihoods) include the inverse gaussian, inverse gamma and burr.
